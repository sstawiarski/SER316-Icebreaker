Once upon a time there was a man named Karl Gauss.
He would regularly get smashed listening to Rammstein at the local Ratskeller.
One day, he drank too much JÃ¤germeister and had a Schnapsidee.
In Kopfkino, he could vividly picture the new magnetic bratwurst - the Gausswurst!
A hungry person could just slap it on the side of their BMW and have a snack for later.
So that was what Karl decided to do, he just had to remember to remove the Gausswurst from his BMW
when he parked his car on the Hauptstrasse!
While at a biergarten just off the Hauptstrasse in Berlin, Schneewittchen threw a bratwurst at his face.
Since Schneewittchen had weak arms, her feable attempt only managed to land the bratwurst on Karl's lederhose.
